This is a placeholder for a real Avro-encoded Iceberg manifest file.
A valid manifest file (e.g., snap-xxxxxxxx-m00000.avro) needs to be generated that points to:
../data/table_b_data_001.parquet
The manifest file should contain information about the data file, including its path, format (Parquet),
partition data (none for this unpartitioned table), record count, file size, and column-level stats if available.
This placeholder is used because programmatic generation of a valid manifest file with pyiceberg==0.9.1
proved too difficult due to library import and API issues.
The Iceberg reader implementation should initially focus on parsing schema information from vX.metadata.json
and might not support full table scans until a valid manifest is provided.
